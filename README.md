# Monitor-App

“Monitor” is a cloud-based sensor monitoring and alert management platform which can be used to centrally monitor any device regardless of its location. The system can be used to alert certain events based on the readings coming from the sensors.

The monitor system performs the monitoring part only (The alert generation and notifying the user when there is a device failure)

When there is an alert, the system will notify the user either by Email/SMS or Phone call
